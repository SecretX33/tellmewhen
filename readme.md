A customized version of TellMeWhen for World of Warcraft 3.3.5a

The original version of TellMeWhen can be found here https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/tellmewhen

Since the first time I put my eyes on this addon, I knew this was made for me - and I was right -, but there was some serious problems, the bugs. As TellMeWhen for version 3.3.5a was badly bugged, that is, several of its functions presented problems or didn't work at all, problems that were corrected in later versions of the addon.

That's where I found myself in a situation where it was me who could help myself and my fellow WotLK players - that is -, I decided that I would merge the codes of the newer version with the current version of WoW, doing the right ones adaptations and trying to import the improvements of the future versions to the current version of the addon. And that's how that project was born.
